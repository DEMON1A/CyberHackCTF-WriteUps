### Note:

- I Will Add Pics After Open Ma Windows Machine.

- Most Reverse Was For Windows There But **Still That Is Ma Fav Kind**, I Got AN EXE From The Challenge Called Magic Boxed So I Open Ma Windows Machine And Run DIE **< Detect It Easy >** And I Got That This Program Is Compiled In C/C++ With 32Bits, I Think IN This Way I Should Use Normal Debugger, So I Have Opened xdbg32 And Open The Program There First I Remives System Callback From Prefrense To Get In The Real Program Without Getting System Stuff, I Searched For Strings AND GOT NOTHING USEFUL So After A LOT OF PROGRAM RESTARTS AND THIS STUFF I NOTICE That There Is Weird Text Loaded From The Stack I Keep Step Over Code And Step In Call Function Then I Got That Text There Called ```cyberhack{H@ckTh3Box}``` Really I Do Not Remember The Flag But I Think That Is It, I Have Not Need To Test Other Stuff Just Watch The Stack Stuff

## Tips

- Make Your First Step To Check Program PE , Lang The Program Written In , Compiler. That Could Change ALl Reverse Way Here Like If The Program Was ```.NET``` I Will Use [ VS , DNSPY , ILSPY ] To Read The Code And Patch It, Or If Found Any Protection Like ```.NET Reactor``` I Should Clean The Program , Search For Cleaner Like De4dot And This Stuff

- ALways Look To The Stack On The Reverse Proccess The Flag Could Be In Your Eyes While You Do Not Notice It XD

- Make Sure You Understand atleast Assembly 32-Bit To Know WTF UH ARE DOING IN THE REVERSE PROCCESS
