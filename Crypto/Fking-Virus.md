- First Of I Could Not Solve This Challenge Thanks For ```Mohammed Matar``` For Telling Me The Solution Of This Challenge Was Really Wierd For Me, Okay The Challenge Is Giving You Wierd Damn Text With A LOT OF ```['z' , '*']```, The First Thing **Me** Will Do Is Search For Google Even I Search For ```encode with a lot of z and stars```, And No Result There It Takes Some Time For Me Then I Go To Solve Another Challenge, After The CTF Stuff I Have ASK ```Mohammed Matar``` About That And He Got A Solution, He Was Thinking About Replce Starts ```['*']``` With ```0``` And ```z``` With ```1``` Then Decode It As Binary. TO BE HONEST IT SEEMS FOR ME LIKE BAD IDEA BUT WHEN HE TEST IT, IT WORKS, And He Got Base Encoded Text After A While He Got That That Is Base32 Encooded Text Using Simple Command From Terminal ``` echo "{ENCODED}" | base32 -d -i | tee flag.txt ```, He Got The Flag ```cyberhack{w3_m4k3_v1ru5es!}```
