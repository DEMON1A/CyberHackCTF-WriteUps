## Jumping Back
### Crypto

- I Got Text File From The Challenge Contain Some Base Stuff I Have Try To Use Base32 Decode From Terminal Using ```echo "{Base64-Encoded} | base32 -d -i" > BaseFile``` And I Got Other Base Stuff There Then I Tried Same Thing As Last Time In Terminal And Got Unreadble Stuff After Some Time I Got That It Could Be Base32 So Did Other Command On The Terminal With Data I Got In The Last Decode ```echo BaseFile | base64 -d -i > BaseFile``` Then I Got Another Base ```WTF``` AFter Some Tries I Got That I Should Decode It From Base64 One Time And Base32 Other Time And Keep Doing That Until I Get The Flag ```cyberhack{Str1nG_Tr4nsl4T1oN_1s_FuN}```

## Tip

- You Could See That **Base** With A Lot Of Encodes Do Not Contain ```=``` , Also Numbers Encode Is The Same Do Not Idenify Base Stuff With ```=```, But Still You Could Write Bash/Python Script That Could Brute Force Most Base Encoded Texts
